文件操作，无外乎读写，但首先你要打开文件。  

### 打开文件

`f = open(filename, mode)` filename是文件名，可以带目录；mode是读写模式（可以是读，写，追加等）；f是file handler。

### 关闭文件

`f.close()`

### 模式

- "r": Open a file for read only
- "w": Open a file for writing. If file already exists its data will be cleared before opening. Otherwise new file will be created
- "a": Opens a file in append mode i.e to write a data to the end of the file
- "wb": Open a file to write in binary mode
- "rb": Open a file to read in binary mode

### 写入文件

注意，`write`不会自动加入`\n`，这一点不像`print`。


```python
f = open('myfile.txt', 'w')    # open file for writing
f.write('this is first line\n')   # write a line to the file
f.write('this is second line\n')  # write one more line
f.close()
```

### 读文件

总共有三个模式：  

- `read([number])`: Return specified number of characters from the file. if omitted it will read the entire contents of the file.
- `readline()`: Return the next line of the file.
-  `readlines()`: Read all the lines as a list of strings in the file

##### 读取所有内容


```python
f = open('myfile.txt', 'r')
f.read()
```




    'this is first line\nthis is second line\n'




```python
f.close()
```

##### 读取所有行


```python
f = open('myfile.txt','r')
f.readlines()
```




    ['this is first line\n', 'this is second line\n']




```python
f.close()
```

##### 读取一行


```python
f = open('myfile.txt','r')
f.readline()
```




    'this is first line\n'




```python
f.close()
```

### Append


```python
f = open('myfile.txt','a')
f.write('this is third line\n')
```


```python
f.close()
```

### 遍历文件数据


```python
f = open('myfile.txt','r')
for line in f:
    print line,
```

    this is first line
    this is second line
    this is third line



```python
f.close()
```

### `with open`


```python
with open('myfile.txt','r') as f:
    for line in f:
        print line,
```

    this first line
    this second line
    this is third line



```python
with open('myfile.txt','r') as f:
    for line in f.readlines():
        print line,    
```

    this is first line
    this is second line
    this is third line
